Understanding the Prediction Result
===================================

Interpreting the prediction result from a linear regression model involves understanding the relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how to interpret the prediction result in the context of your project:

Understanding Linear Regression
-------------------------------

1. **Linear Regression Model**:

   A linear regression model aims to find the best-fit line that explains the relationship between the input features and the target variable. The model can be represented as:

   .. math::

      Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_nX_n

   where:
   - :math:`Y` is the predicted value.
   - :math:`\beta_0` is the intercept.
   - :math:`\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n` are the coefficients (weights) for the input features :math:`X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n`.

2. **Prediction**:

   The prediction result is the estimated value of the target variable :math:`Y` given a new set of input values for the features :math:`X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n`.

Interpreting the Prediction Result
----------------------------------

1. **Input Features**:

   When you call the `predict` method, you provide an array of input feature values. For example, if you are predicting based on two features :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_2`, you might call the method with an array like `[10.0, 15.0]`.

2. **Predicted Value**:

   The `predict` method uses the trained linear regression model to calculate the predicted value :math:`Y`. For example, if the prediction result is `24.5`, it means that based on the input values :math:`X_1 = 10.0` and :math:`X_2 = 15.0`, the model estimates the target variable :math:`Y` to be `24.5`.

3. **Interpreting the Coefficients**:

   The coefficients (weights) in the linear regression model represent the relationship between each input feature and the target variable. A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation, meaning that as the feature value increases, the target variable tends to increase. A negative coefficient indicates a negative correlation.

Example
-------

Suppose your linear regression model has the following equation:

.. math::

   Y = 3.0 + 2.5X_1 + 1.5X_2

- Intercept (:math:`\beta_0`): `3.0`
- Coefficient for :math:`X_1` (:math:`\beta_1`): `2.5`
- Coefficient for :math:`X_2` (:math:`\beta_2`): `1.5`

Given the input values :math:`X_1 = 10.0` and :math:`X_2 = 15.0`:

1. **Calculate the predicted value :math:`Y`**:

   .. math::

      Y = 3.0 + (2.5 \times 10.0) + (1.5 \times 15.0)
      Y = 3.0 + 25.0 + 22.5
      Y = 50.5

2. **Interpretation**:

   - The predicted value of the target variable :math:`Y` is `50.5` given the input values :math:`X_1 = 10.0` and :math:`X_2 = 15.0`.
   - The coefficient for :math:`X_1` (`2.5`) indicates that for each unit increase in :math:`X_1`, the target variable :math:`Y` increases by `2.5` units, assuming all other variables remain constant.
   - The coefficient for :math:`X_2` (`1.5`) indicates that for each unit increase in :math:`X_2`, the target variable :math:`Y` increases by `1.5` units, assuming all other variables remain constant.

Summary
-------

- **Prediction result**: The output of the `predict` method, representing the estimated value of the target variable based on the input features.
- **Coefficients**: Values indicating the relationship between each input feature and the target variable, used to calculate the prediction.
- **Interpretation**: Understanding the predicted value and the impact of each feature on the prediction.

By understanding these aspects, you can effectively interpret the results of your linear regression model and make informed decisions based on the predictions.
